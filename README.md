# AI Playground

This repository collects quick experiments and reusable components for transformer architectures and state-space model (SSM) projects. Expect lightweight prototypes, training scripts, and utility code that make it easy to compare and iterate on modern sequence modeling ideas.

Jump in, explore the models, and use the pieces that help you move faster on your own AI workflows.
